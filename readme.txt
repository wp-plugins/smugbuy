A plugin to automatically insert SmugMug buy links into wordpress posts and pages using a shortcode.

== Description ==

In January 2011 SmugMug introduced a new feature that enabled users to add a photo directly to the SmugMug shopping
cart from external websites.  This plugin parses the standard SmugMug photo page and automatically creates a custom
tailored "buy" link to add to your WordPress posts and pages via a shortcode.

Visit the [SmugBuy homepage](http://chrismartino.com/smugbuy/) for more information on how to incorporate the plugin into your blog.
